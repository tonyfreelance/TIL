# How to plan and organize things before going to code

### First, on paper:
- I write down the objective of the thing I am coding
- I break that objective into steps
- Every major step is then broken down into even smaller bits

### Then in the editor:

- At the beginning of my code, I add comments with the major steps. 
- This way I always have a list to remind me what I should be doing next.
- I add comments in my code describing what I am doing so if I’ll get back in a few months to the code I wrote I will understand it easier. This is not the case right now, as I’m working only on very small projects, but I think it’s good practice.
